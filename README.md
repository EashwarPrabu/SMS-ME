# SMS-ME (State Monitoring Solution for Medical Equipment)

Our project SMS-ME aims at providing an easy way to monitor the medical equipment in every room of a hospital, send those data to the server and store it in the database for further understanding. This can be achieved with the help of IoT (Internet of Things). This project has two such IoT devices, the Hub and the Spoke. The project consists of a web application which is used for data visualization.
